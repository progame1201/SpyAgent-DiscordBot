# SpyAgent-DiscordBot description
a bot that allows you to track messages on connected servers and also send messages to selected channels on behalf of the bot
# How to use it?
you have to go to the website: https://discord.com/developers/applications then create your own discord bot <br>
<br>
next, you will need to switch the lower toggle switches in the bot tab.<br> Next, generate your link and invite your bot to your server.<br> Next, you need to get your bot's token and insert it into the application.<br> Then select the server and channel and you can now use it.<br> If you want to change the server and the text channel, then when sending a message, you can write ***Reset and select the server and the text channel. 


Basically I wrote this application using ChatGPT as I have no idea how to write bots for discord and if this is bad code then I understand and you can create a pull request.
