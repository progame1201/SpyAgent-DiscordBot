# SpyAgent-DiscordBot description
a bot that allows you to track messages on connected servers and also send messages to selected channels on behalf of the bot
# How to use it?
you have to go to the website: https://discord.com/developers/applications then create your own discord bot 
<img scr="https://i.ibb.co/G0Kdcc0/1312313231.png"/>
then press all these toggle switches. Next, generate your link and invite your bot to your server. Next, you need to get your bot's token and insert it into the application. Then select the server and channel and you can now use it. If you want to change the server and the text channel, then when sending a message, you can write ***Reset and select the server and the text channel. 


Basically I wrote this application using ChatGPT as I have no idea how to write bots for discord and if this is bad code then I understand and you can create a pull request.
